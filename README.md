Dependencies
------------
```
ntk  (git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/non/fltk.git ntk)
cairo
cairomm-1.0
sndfile
lv2
```

Install
-------
Once deps are satisfied, building and installing into ~/.lv2/ is easy,
just run CMake as usual:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

Running
-------
After the `Install` step Ardour3, QTractor, and any other LV2 host should
automatically find Fabla, and be able to use it.

If you have the JALV LV2 host installed, the "run.sh" script can be used to
launch Fabla as a standalone JACK client:
```
$ ./run.sh
```
